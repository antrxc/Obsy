# Security Policy



If you discover a security vulnerability in Obsy, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, email uiantric06@gmail.com or contact @antrxc on GitHub with details and, if possible, a minimal reproduction.

We aim to acknowledge reports within a reasonable time and will coordinate a fix and disclosure.
